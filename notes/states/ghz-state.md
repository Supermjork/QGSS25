The Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state is the extension to three (or more) qubits to the maximally entangled state characteristic of the Bell state depicted above. That means that the GHZ state is:
$$
\vert GHZ \rangle = \frac{\vert 0 0 0 \rangle + \vert 1 1 1 \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
$$
One of the interesting features of the GHZ state is that there are different and equivalent ways to build it using a quantum circuit. In Exercise 1 you will do it in one of the most common ways.
