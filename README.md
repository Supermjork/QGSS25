# QGSS25

My study repository for IBM's QGSS25.

## Hello

I'm Mark (or MjÃ¸rk), and I've created this repository to try my best to document this experience.

## Layout

As of writing this on the 2nd of July 2025, I imagine that this would be split into a few folders. This repository will be accessed in a hybrid manner by VSCode and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

- Notes (Per Day)
- Labs (1 -> 4)
